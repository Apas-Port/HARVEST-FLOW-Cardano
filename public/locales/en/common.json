    "description": "Have questions about HARVEST FLOW? Take a look at the answers to our most frequently asked questions below.",
    "items": {
      "1": {
        "question": "What is the structure of the HARVEST FLOW service?",
        "answer": "HARVEST FLOW is a service in which we hold your crypto assets for a fixed period and return the same quantity and type of crypto assets at the end of the contract term, along with lending fees calculated at a fixed rate. It is a crypto asset lending (loan-for-consumption) service provided in accordance with Japanese law, ensuring a safe and reliable experience for our users."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "How is HARVEST FLOW different from other lending services?",
        "answer": "HARVEST FLOW is an innovative lending service that aims to achieve both profitability and social impact by lending to real-world projects (RWAs) that aim to improve the world. We call this combination of generating stable income and contributing to society a \"Social Action,\" which is a core mission of HARVEST FLOW in building a sustainable future."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Can I use HARVEST FLOW if I don't own any crypto assets?",
        "answer": "To use HARVEST FLOW, you need to hold the specific crypto asset designated in each project."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Can I cancel the lending contract before the end of the term?",
        "answer": "In principle, early termination is not allowed. However, since the Proof of Support is issued as an NFT, it can be traded on external marketplaces such as OpenSea or Magic Eden. While HARVEST FLOW may assist with creating collection pages or setting royalties, it does not participate in or guarantee any secondary market transactions."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "How is the lending fee calculated?",
        "answer": "The lending fee is generally calculated using the formula below:\n\nInterest =  \n(Quantity of the same type of crypto asset corresponding to the number of lending units) × (Lending fee rate) ×  \nSeconds from the project's defined execution time to the time when the request is received from the Proof of Support (NFT) holder  \n(If that time is after the project's lending period has ended, calculation is capped at the end of the lending period) ÷ (60×60×24×365)  \n− Lending fees already paid by us to the Proof of Support holder\n\nThe payout frequency, timing, and fee rate vary by project. Please refer to each project page for details."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "Where can I ask questions or get support?",
        "answer": "Please ask your questions in HARVEST HALL's <a href='https://discord.gg/harvesthall' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Discord</a>."
